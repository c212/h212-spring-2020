Step 11.

Step 3

Next I created a method drawPath() that draws a path between two 
nodes and then used two for loops to loop through each node in the 
graph and connect each node to its neighbors. I added an x and a y 
coordinate as attributes in the Node class and then assigned these 
x and y variables when I drew the node in drawNode so I could use 
them later when drawing paths. I used the drawArrowLine method from 
the C212 website and modified it so that the arrow is placed in the 
middle of the path instead of on the end. This way you can clearly 
see which way the path is going but all the paths still start and 
end at identical x and y coordinates (making their placement easier).
