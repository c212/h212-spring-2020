Step 3

Next I made a new class Neighbors to store neighbors of nodes that 
extends ArrayList. I chose to extend ArrayList so that I can add more 
methods later and give the class a descriptive name while still keeping 
all the functionality of an ArrayList. So far I only overwrote the 
constructor to take an array of nodes and did not add any more custom 
methods.
