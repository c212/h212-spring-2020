Step 6

Next it was time to start implementing the Graph class. I started 
by extending the HashMap that already exists in java to represent 
the graph in the form of an adjacency list. The class Graph maps 
Node objects to Neighbors objects, and because of the work I did 
in the Node class it will always consider nodes with the same name 
as the same node (even if we had to make a different Node object 
to refer to them). I added a .show() method that prints a text 
representation of the graph by printing each node followed by its 
neighbors and ends the message with "---". I also added a method 
called .neighborsOf() that essentially calls the .get() method for 
the Graph class, but it makes it more clear what information we are 
actually getting.
