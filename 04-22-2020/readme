Step 7

Finally I added a method to the Graph class that implements BFS 
for the shortest path from a starting node to a target node. The 
first argument is the target node and the second argument is a 
Paths object that contains one Path object that contains only 
the starting node. I have put in comments that say specifically 
what each line is doing, but essentially the function checks if 
the target node has already been reached with one of the candidate 
paths, and if it has not been reached yet it adds the neighbors of 
the last node of each candidate path to make a new set of candidate 
and checks to see if those paths reach the target node recursively. 
If one of the candidates is a dead end (i.e. the last node in a path 
has no neighbors) it will print a warning message and stop pursuing 
that candidate).
