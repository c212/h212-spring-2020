Step 9, I guess...

Part 2: Visualization of BFS

Part 1

First, I created a new class called GraphVis where I can implement my 
visualization of the graph. I made it an extension of JComponent and in 
the main method I constructed a JFrame and set it to visible with a size 
of 500 to 500 (for now, I may change this to be customizable later on). 
I also added a place to construct the graph I wanted to visualize as well 
as placeholders for my drawing object and adding the drawing to the frame.
