Step 4

Next I did the same for a class Path to store nodes in a path 
from one node to another in the graph. I added two constructors, 
one that takes no arguments and can be used to make an empty path 
and one that takes a node and adds that node to a new path. I also 
added a method .clone() that takes a path and returns a new path 
that is an exact copy.
