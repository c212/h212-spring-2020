Step 2

Next I overrode the hashCode() method. I changed the hashCode() method 
so it would return the hashCode() of the name of the Node (so two nodes 
with the same name will return the same hashcode). I also added a .equals() 
method that would return whether two nodes have the same name or not (not 
whether they are the same object or not). I also added some unit testing to 
make sure Nodes would behave as intended when used in a hashmap.
