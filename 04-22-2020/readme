Next I wanted the shortestPath() method to return all of the paths 
traversed during the search (in order) as well as the best path. I 
added a parameter to the method to pass the list of all paths traversed 
through the recursion and created a class Pair so that I could return both 
of these items at the same time when the method was done.
